What does <span class="mention">@everyone</span> think? Should we have a 40 player limit for this game?<br /><b>A 40 player limit means:</b><br />- No giant voting polls<br />- We can start earlier (maybe Thursday, probably Friday)<br />- Higher chance of getting a certain role<br />- Higher chance of winning the game<br /><b>More players means:</b><br />- More (active) players to play with<br />- More (and crazier) roles<br />- You can still invite all your friends to come over<br />- We can start this weekend<br /><br />What do you think? Click &#128078; if you want a 40 player limit, and &#128077; if you want to wait for/invite more friends. Remember, 40 players means that there&#39;s only two slots left!</div>

<b>===========================<br />Latest news: New announcement!<br />===========================</b><br />The last two games, we have gained complaints about people being inactive for a long time. The game has been designed in such a manner that <b>it is allowed to not be very active</b>, but it felt dishonest to some active players that they died very quickly, and the inactives got to see the end of the game without doing anything.<br /><br />We have decided not to discourage absence, but instead encourage presence. You can now earn <b>blood points</b> <img class="emoji" title=":blood:" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/384414366897930240.png" /> as a player, when you are really active.<br /><br /><b>How do you earn blood points?</b><br />Did you say something funny? Did you just mislead another player in a masterful way? Did you make a great discovery? Did you have a good talk? Were you roleplaying well? Then the <span class="mention">@Game Master</span>s will add the <img class="emoji" title=":blood:" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/384414366897930240.png" /> reaction to your message. This means that you have earned a <b>blood point</b>.<br /><br /><b>I&#39;ve got a few blood points. So what?</b><br />When you have reached a certain amount of blood points (we will keep it a secret for now), you will gain a DM of the <span class="mention">@Game Master</span>s, which will tell you that you reached the maximum. With your blood points, you can buy an <i>invisibility cloak</i> that will prevent you from getting killed by <i>any</i> team. <i>(All other effects, like curses, fortune telling, crowd seeking etc. will still work)</i><br /><br /><b>Can I stack my invisibility cloaks?</b><br />No. When you buy an invisibility cloak, you will lose <b>all</b> your earned blood points. Once you used your invisibility cloak, you can start earning blood points again.<br /><br /><b>Can I give my invisibility cloak away?</b><br />Sure! If you think you&#39;re safe, but your ally needs to be protected, you can just give your cloak away to someone in need. They will know they gained a free cloak, but they won&#39;t know who gave it to them. So you&#39;ll get to choose whether you tell them it was you...<span class="msg-edited" title="30-Nov-17 10:00 ">(edited)</span></div>

What, did you like the stories of TumbleTown and Verdict Village? You want to hear another story? Alright, then let&#39;s make it a good one. This one&#39;s about Evil End, a small village near the borders of our neighbouring country, where travelers stopped to sleep for one night. And it seems like one of Daniels children had passed by.<br />&quot;It happens every winter,&quot; <span class="mention" title="Chopper2112#496">@Chopper2112</span> told the others in the <span class="mention">#s3_tavern</span>. &quot;This town is plagued every year by werewolves!&quot; <span class="mention" title="Leviticus#4878">@Leviticus</span>, <span class="mention" title="ProNoob135#1100">@ProNoob135</span> and the <span class="mention" title="Lord of Galaxy#9211">@Lord of Galaxy</span> were listening, but they didn&#39;t believe him. Sure, the previous winter, <span class="mention" title="MichaelMouseStar#4266">@MichaelMouseStar</span> had found a dead body in an alleyway, with two strange marks in their neck, but that was all. No fur, no murder, no unexpected deaths.<br /><br />But they didn&#39;t know a son of Daniel had visited the town. They had recruited and infected some people, and they were living among the city already.

Even though the <span class="mention">@Mayor</span> wasn&#39;t very popular the last few days, <span class="mention">@everyone</span> was surprised when they found <span class="mention" title="BlendedSpider#914">@BlendedSpider</span>&#39;s body lying on <span class="mention">#s3_town_square</span>.

Nobody knew exactly why; maybe there was more to him than met the eye...<br /><br />The town was also disappointed; no, the fact that nobody died yesterday, didn&#39;t mean that it was finally over.

No matter how dark, cruel or horrifying they are, people always seem to keep their traditions. So it was once again happening that the <span class="mention">@Mayor</span> had to be killed.

Hello there, <span class="mention">@everyone</span>,<br /><br />Sorry for disturbing you! No, we haven&#39;t opened the signup yet, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not doing anything! In contrary, we&#39;re working very hard on our very own <b>Werewolf Discord Bot</b><br />40 players is almost impossible to handle, and our goal of 100 players is nearly impossible. That&#39;s why we have decided to create a bot that does the administration for us.<br />Believe it ot not, but we&#39;re already close to finishing it! All we need is some test runs with some volunteers! Don&#39;t expect any real gameplay (everyone will know everyone&#39;s roles,the game will end abruptly, no rewards to gain), but we need some peeps to test all roles.<br />Please keep it civil, the other server is a bad replica of this one. If you want to help testing it, come over at <a href="https://discord.gg/hbCV6Hw">https://discord.gg/hbCV6Hw</a> !<br /><br />Randium<span class="msg-edited" title="13-Dez-17 03:32 ">(edited)</span></div>
