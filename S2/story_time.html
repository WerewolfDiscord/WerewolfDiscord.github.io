Now th&#225;t was a scary story, my friends! Did you like the story of <i>TumbleTown</i>? Well, if you like that kind of stories, <span class="mention">@here</span>&#39;s another one for you;</div>

You probably haven&#39;t heard of <i>Verdict Village</i>, have you? Well, let me explain why.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<i>Verdict Village</i> once was a small but strong village in the eastern parts of the country. The climate was rough, but the village still blossomed.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
The town was ruled by <span class="mention" title="Regicide1218#5350">@Regicide1218</span>, a mighty noblesman who knew how to rule Verdict Village. With the help of his royal <span class="mention" title="cashwarrior1#5973">@cashwarrior1</span>, he managed to keep everything under control.</div>

Dawn has broken. As the word of the curse spread throughout the village, an eerie quiet set about the place. The thudding of a hammer was heard as it drove its nail through into the timbers of a hastily errected structure at the Town&#39;s Square.<br />The arching crook lingering above the morning mist as the loop of rope awaited its first victim. <br /><br />A parchment, hung from the timber, with an official seal read;<br /><i>The Curse of the wolves has fallen upon this land. None may rest while we root out the vicious beasts. the monsters hidden in plain sight will hang after democratic trial. Cast your ballots before sun down!</i></div>
<div class="msg-content">
Who placed that parchment? The message would not have been taken seriously, if it didn&#39;t have the king&#39;s official seal upon it. Was it the same letter that <span class="mention" title="Regicide1218#5350">@Regicide1218</span> had read?</div>
<div class="msg-content">
Puh, werewolves, what a mumbo jumbo! Although... the day was filled with doubt. <span class="mention">@everyone</span> knew the story about <i>TumbleTown</i>, but that was only a myth to scare the young...</div>
<div class="msg-content">
Nonetheless, strange things did happen. Just like in <i>TumbleTown</i>, a thick fog had appeared, locking the village up between a thick mist and a great raveyn. Those who tried to escape through the mist, always happened to return to the town. How strange!</div>
<div class="msg-content">
<i>TumbleTown</i> was just a scary story! A werewolf eating the whole town, puh! However, the town chose not to take any risk.</div>
<div class="msg-content">

He must die!&quot;</i><br /><i>&quot;He&#39;s lying! He&#39;s deceiving you all!&quot;</i><br /><i>&quot;A friend of mine told me he saw him change!&quot;</i><br /><i>&quot;That&#39;s stupid! Why would a <span class="mention">@Guardian</span> need to change shape?&quot;</i><br />The town seemed to be split between the two, until the <span class="mention">@Mayor</span> spoke. <i></i><i>&quot;Silence!&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;Let me make the decision.&quot;</i> After having heard arguments of both parties, he came to a decision. <i>&quot;I am sorry, my friend,&quot; <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span> told his <span class="mention">@Guardian</span> <span class="mention" title="marhjo#5178">@marhjo</span>, </i>&quot;but your job is going to end soon.&quot;<i><br />The rest of the town was silent. Only the refusal of <span class="mention" title="marhjo#5178">@marhjo</span> was heard before they brought him to the town&#39;s square.<br /><br />Nobody in </i>Verdict Village<i> didn&#39;t like the killing though - everything seemed more and more like the story in </i>TumbleTown*. Anything that reminded them of that mocking story needed to be changed. And so it happened.<br /><br />Instead of hanging him up, <span class="mention" title="marhjo#5178">@marhjo</span> was strapped to a wooden pile. A fire was made, and all they heard from <span class="mention" title="marhjo#5178">@marhjo</span> were his last screams of pain, before the fire had melted his neck to dust.<br />The fire kept the citizens warm, but they feared that the curse wouldn&#39;t be over so quickly. So they quickly disappeared to their houses, letting only the homeless enjoy the huge campfire.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
However, the town hadn&#39;t left the fire before they announced their new reporter. <span class="mention">@everyone</span> happily greeted <span class="mention" title="Legolas#2139">@Legolas</span>, who would now investigate all the bodies to gain more information. Everyone hoped <span class="mention" title="Legolas#2139">@Legolas</span> would tell the truth, but of course, even <span class="mention" title="Legolas#2139">@Legolas</span> knew that hiding the truth could sometimes be very useful...</div>

Unfortunately, the town was right. The curse had not ended. In contrary, some people lying in dumpsters claim to have heard some whispers in the alleyway; <i>&quot;Let&#39;s rip his hair and facial features.&quot; &quot;Crucify him by sticking a spear and a sword into him in the town square!&quot; &quot;Let&#39;s set him on fire! That&#39;ll teach them.&quot; &quot;Before he dies, make him dig his own grave!&quot; &quot;Carve &#39;I love furries&#39; on his arm.&quot; &quot;No, even better; write &#39;The killings won&#39;t stop&#39;!&quot; &quot;Cut out his tounge!&quot; &quot;Replace his eyes with eggs, and cover him with pig blood!&quot;</i> That&#39;s all the few survivors around the campfire could make up, before the sentences slowly sounded very distant.<span class="msg-edited" title="22-Nov-17 10:00 ">(edited)</span></div>

The last day has been the worst the day that <i>Verdict Village</i> had ever encountered. So much blood was wasted, so many had died. The town hoped it would all end now.<br />But it didn&#39;t. The screams of <span class="mention" title="Freedmoon#1128">@Freedmoon</span> only seemed to suggest that... he would be avenged.

<div class="msg-content">
At the end of the day, it turned out that none seemed to be impressed - they knew that all the suspects <i>suddenly</i> start talking when their time has come. Or didn&#39;t they dare to vote against the <span class="mention">@Mayor</span>, fearing that they would be the next to die?</div>
<div class="msg-content">
What was clear to all, was that <span class="mention" title="Freedmoon#1128">@Freedmoon</span>&#39;s doomsaying did not have a direct result - he died a painful and slow death on the campfire.<br />The hope still remained that the curse would finally be over - but no, the citizens were <i>foolish</i> to believe such a thing. For the <b>werewolves</b> were still roaming around the city, already on the hunt, looking for their next prey...</div>

Unlike the previous night, only one victim had fallen. Nobody complained that they didn&#39;t die, but all were curious what could&#39;ve happened. Weren&#39;t the werewolves hungry enough?

The town was sure about it!

He had to die!<br /><br />As any healthy town, <i>Verdict Village</i> did not tolerate murder, so they decided to burn <span class="mention" title="ville#2962">@ville</span> alive! That&#39;ll teach him to kill <span class="mention" title="Marsim#9859">@Marsim</span>.<br />The town ate a good meal of roasted meat on the fire before they went to bed.<br /><i>(Don&#39;t worry, it was chicken, not <span class="mention" title="ville#2962">@ville</span>, that was roasted and eaten.)</i><br /><br />They celebrated, because they were sure the curse had finally lift off. Tomorrow, they would happily leave the town, freed from the werewolves. Or so they thought. &#39;cause the werewolves enjoyed the smell of rotten meat, and they wanted just a bit more....</div>

Even though it was late, something weird had happened in the late evening; the mist had disappeared! <span class="mention">@everyone</span> was free to go, to explore the world once more!<br /><i>Verdict Village</i> was abandoned, never to be visited again. None wanted to be reminded of all their loved ones they had lost in that horrible town. The survivors lived on, to live long, happy lives.<br />The <span class="mention">@Mayor</span>, <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>, became a wealthy man, gaining great rewards for exterminating the problem, even though his own life was at risk. Stories were told that he once outran the werewolves himself, to keep the others safe.<br />So did the <span class="mention">@Guardian</span> <span class="mention" title="Lord of Galaxy#9211">@Lord of Galaxy</span> and the <span class="mention">@Reporter</span> <span class="mention" title="Regicide1218#5350">@Regicide1218</span> become respected men. They were employed by the king himself, who made them wealthy and happily ever after.<br /><br />The lands were freed of the curse forever! Or so they thought, for <span class="mention" title="Ruebe5w#2877">@Ruebe5w</span>, a <span class="pre">cursed civilian</span>, gave the curse to his children, who then gave it to their children, who gave it to their children, and so forth... No, the lands were not freed from the werewolves&#39; curse yet. They had lost the battle, but the war wasn&#39;t over. <i>It would never be.</i><br /><br />And that is the story of <i>Verdict Village</i>. The town who was abandoned after it was freed. The werewolves are gone forever, but heed for those who have <span class="mention" title="Ruebe5w#2877">@Ruebe5w</span> as an ancestor. For they may once more haunt the lands with the curse... the forsaken curse of <i><b>THE WEREWOLVES</b></i>.<span class="msg-edited" title="26-Nov-17 09:19 ">(edited)</span></div>
