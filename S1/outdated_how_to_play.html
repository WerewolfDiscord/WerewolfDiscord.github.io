Hey there, <span class="mention">@everyone</span>! Welcome to <i>werewolves</i>! Some of you may know this game, some may know a similar (forum) game called <i>Mafia</i>, but in this channel, you can read how the game exactly works.<br /><br />The game is simple. You need to stay alive until the game ends. If the game is over and you&#39;re alive, you win. If you&#39;re dead before the game ends, you lose.<br />For more details, please read the other posts over <span class="mention">@here</span>.<span class="msg-edited" title="02-Nov-17 10:06 ">(edited)</span></div>
<div class="msg-content">
<b>These are the most important roles, <span class="mention">@everyone</span></b><br /><br /><div class="pre">INNOCENTS<br /></div><br />All roles in this category share one goal; kill every member that is part of the Werewolf team.<br /><br /><b>Innocents</b><br />This is the basic role of the game. Find out who the werewolves are, and vote for them to kill them off!<br /><br /><b>Bakers</b><br />Bakers know who all the other bakers are. They are all innocent.<br /><br /><b>The runner</b><br />The runner will escape death if the werewolves attempt to eat him. This only works once.<br /><br /><b>Fortune teller</b><br />Each night, the fortune teller can see the role of one player.<br /><br /><b>Huntress</b><br />When the huntress dies, she can choose to kill another player.<br /><br /><b>Cupid</b><br />The first night, Cupid will select a <i>lover</i>. Cupid and the lover can only win together; if one gets eliminated, they both die. <i>(That&#39;s how much they love each other)</i><br />If the lover is a werewolf, they&#39;ll have to kill off everybody else.<br /><br /><b>Cult member</b><br />At night, the cult members vote to kill an outsider.<br /><br /><b>Cult Leader</b><br />This player has the same rights as the cult members. If they die, all <i>cult members</i> become normal civilians.<br /><br /><b>Cursed Civilian</b><br />If this player gets eaten by the werewolves, he will turn into a werewolf.<br /><br /><b>Crowd Seeker</b><br />The crowd seeker can give three names each night. He will learn their roles (in a random order).<br /><br /><div class="pre">WEREWOLVES<br /></div><br /><b>Werewolf</b><br />You are a werewolf! It is your job to kill everyone who is not a werewolf.<br /><br /><b>White Werewolf</b><br />This werewolf wins if they are the only player alive. They will act like a normal werewolf, but will also try to eliminate all werewolves.<br /><br /><b>Warlock</b><br />The warlock is a corrupted fortune teller. The role works the same as the fortune teller, but the warlock wins when the werewolves win.<br /><br /><div class="pre">FLUTE PLAYER<br /></div><br /><br /><b>Flute Player</b><br />Each night, the flute player chooses two players to become flute victims. Once everyone but him is a flute victim, the flute player wins the game. Flute victims keep their roles, but they know who the other victims are.<span class="msg-edited" title="19-Nov-17 08:50 ">(edited)</span></div>

<span class="pre">What happens during daytime.</span><br />Every day, the town points out to a suspect who they think might be a werewolf. At the end of the day, the person that has the most votes on him on the poll in <span class="mention">#s1_story_time</span>, will get killed in front of the whole town. <br />Remember: if you&#39;re about to get killed, <i>you may bluff, lie, pretend and make up the weirdest stories</i> if that makes you stay alive.<br /><br /><span class="pre">What happens during nighttime.</span><br />While the town is sleeping, several channels like <span class="mention">#s1_werewolves</span>, <span class="mention">#s1_fortune_teller</span> and <span class="mention">#deleted-channel</span> become active. Here, people will do special actions during the night that will have effect on the progress of the game during the day.<br />Usually, the werewolves choose  a prey and eat it.<span class="msg-edited" title="02-Nov-17 09:59 ">(edited)</span></div>

As <span class="mention">@everyone</span> might be able to see, we now have a new category called <b>Conspiracy channels</b>.

If you want to create a conspiracy channel, you will need to tell me send me a personal message with the following information:<br /><b>The members</b>; who will join?<br /><b>The code-word</b>; not really crucial, but I need to give the channels <i>some</i> names...<span class="msg-edited" title="09-Nov-17 02:25 ">(edited)</span></div>

Sooo... after having several complications with time zones, we have decided to change the day-night rhythm. Instead of the day and night shifting back and forth, the night will now be an hour longer.<br />From now on, the days will start at <span class="pre">09:00</span> GMT and will end at <span class="pre">20:00</span> GMT.<br />For reference towards GMT; <a href="https://time.is/en/GMT">https://time.is/en/GMT</a><span class="msg-edited" title="19-Nov-17 07:46 ">(edited)</span></div>
