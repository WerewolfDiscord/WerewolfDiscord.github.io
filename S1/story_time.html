Gather &#39;round, <span class="mention">@everyone</span>, gather &#39;round! Here, let me tell you of a story about <b>love</b> and <b>betrayal</b>, of <i>glory</i> and <i>redemption</i>. I will tell you the story of the origin of TumbleTown.<br />TumbleTown, who doesn&#39;t know the story? About the werewolves, who tried to kill them all! None in this land would dare to forget its wonderful tale.<br /><br />It all started when <span class="mention" title="Buddy1913#9588">@Buddy1913</span> founded this place; the landscape was beautiful! <i>&quot;From this day on, this town shall be known as ...&quot;</i>, and before he could make up a name, his dearest friend, <span class="mention" title="ciphercobra#9766">@ciphercobra</span>, fell over a small stone. This made <span class="mention" title="Buddy1913#9588">@Buddy1913</span> laugh for a while, and he said, <i>&quot;Very well, then. To honour my friend, and to tease his agility, this town shall be known as <b>TumbleTown</b>!&quot;</i><br /><span class="mention" title="Buddy1913#9588">@Buddy1913</span> and <span class="mention" title="ciphercobra#9766">@ciphercobra</span> wanted to make use of this wonderful place, and they invited their friends to live with them in this town. <span class="mention" title="Vyryn#4618">@Vyryn</span>, <span class="mention" title="Legolas#2139">@Legolas</span>, and <span class="mention" title="&#167;įŕ Ţ&#253;phů&#167;#5185">@&#167;įŕ Ţ&#253;phů&#167;</span>. The popularity of those three gentlemen made the town the place-to-be, and soon people from far and wide started coming in. The well-known <span class="mention" title="Thrimian#7285">@Thrimian</span>, the poor but friendly <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>, the old but wise <span class="mention" title="Stuart#2896">@Stuart</span>, <span class="mention" title="alekkat#349">@alekkat</span>, <span class="mention" title="Toiletti#2969">@Toiletti</span>, and many more!<br />Everything was destined to go well, if not for that faithfull day... when <span class="mention" title="Elcar0#1528">@Elcar0</span> showed up with a horrifying message. <i>&quot;Flee while you can,&quot;</i> <span class="mention" title="Elcar0#1528">@Elcar0</span> screamed, <i>&quot;for these lands have been cursed by the devil himself!&quot;</i><br /><br /><i>&quot;Those who die will not rest until their souls have seen the end of days!&quot;</i><br /><br />Some people, like <span class="mention" title="BhunaBoy#4095">@BhunaBoy</span> and <span class="mention" title="Comic_Sads#9666">@Comic_Sads</span> knew <span class="mention" title="Elcar0#1528">@Elcar0</span>&#39;s fortune-telling powers, and that they had to be taken seriously. But the rest of the people used rational arguments like <i>pfft</i> and <i>fuck that</i> to decide that they would stay where they were.<span class="msg-edited" title="07-Nov-17 10:57 ">(edited)</span></div>

That night, <span class="mention">@everyone</span> woke up from a scream so scary, it must&#39;ve come from Hell itself. The full moon was shining brighter than the sun ever had.<br /><i>(Which is physically impossible, since the moon&#39;s light is coming indirectly from the sun, a paradox! Now <b>that</b> is scary!)</i><br />The next day, blood was found everywhere, and little survivors remained! The mist has gone so incredibly thick, that those who tried to escape the town, always ended up walking back to the town. They were trapped! Even worse, <span class="mention" title="Elcar0#1528">@Elcar0</span> seemed to have lost its fortune-powers, so he couldn&#39;t predict what was coming. <i>(Or did he just pretend, to prevent people from their disastrous future?)</i><br />All he could tell them, was <i>&quot;The werewolves. It&#39;s the werewolves!They&#39;re coming...&quot;</i><span class="msg-edited" title="07-Nov-17 11:10 ">(edited)</span></div>

TumbleTown had some strong survivors; they knew that even food, drink, conserving energy and hygiene are less important to survive than <i>spirit</i> and <i>the will to survive</i>.

The well-known old man of the town, <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>, was today&#39;s victim. <span class="mention">@everyone</span> was said to see him go. Even the ghosts of the unresting souls of those who had died before, felt pity for him.</div>
<div class="msg-content">
The sorrow was so great, that <span class="mention" title="Thrimian#7285">@Thrimian</span> rushed into <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>&#39;s house. When he did not return when it was already dark, the <span class="mention">@deleted-role</span> went to look inside.<br />What he saw, was <span class="mention" title="Thrimian#7285">@Thrimian</span> lying on the ground, his chest pinned to the wall by <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>&#39;s old cane. His fingers were still crampled in a grip around the cane, and it was clear to see that <span class="mention" title="Thrimian#7285">@Thrimian</span> had committed suicide. He could not live on without <span class="mention" title="JR [FFF]#6781">@JR [FFF]</span>, so he decided to end it.</div>

He knew all was lost, but the last man did not want to give up now. Maybe, a miracle would happen, and the werewolf would somehow fall asleep tonight instead of eating him...
